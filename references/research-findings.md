# Research Findings

What we know about dating app behavior, and where we know it from. This grounds the skill's recommendations in evidence — peer-reviewed research where it exists, platform data where it's available, and practical consensus where that's all there is.

We're honest about the evidence quality throughout. Three tiers:

- **Research** — Peer-reviewed, published in academic journals
- **Platform data** — Published by dating apps themselves (Hinge, OkCupid, Tinder). Credible but self-reported and selectively disclosed
- **Conventional wisdom** — Widely accepted in the dating coaching space but not formally studied. May be right, but treat as informed opinion

## Photos Matter More Than Text

The single most consistent finding across all dating app research: photos dominate decision-making.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Photos are the dominant factor in swipe decisions; bio text has minimal impact on right-swipe rates | Tyson et al. (2016), IEEE/ACM ASONAM | Research |
| Photos receive the majority of visual attention in dating profiles | Brand et al. (2012), *Computers in Human Behavior* | Research |
| Profile photos serve as the primary impression management tool; users are strategic in photo selection | Ward (2017), *Information, Communication & Society* | Research |
| Smiling faces are rated as more attractive and more trustworthy | Sedgewick et al. (2017), *Frontiers in Psychology* | Research |
| Profiles with all photo slots filled receive significantly more engagement | Hinge blog/press data | Platform data |

**What this means:** First photo is the primary filter point. If it doesn't work, nothing else gets seen. But "10x impact" and "178% more matches from professional photos" — specific stats you'll see on dating advice blogs — are not from real studies. The directional finding is robust; the precise numbers are invented.

### Photo red flags

Mirror selfies, bathroom pics, heavy filters, and all-selfie profiles are consistently cited as turn-offs across dating advice and survey data. This is **conventional wisdom** — no peer-reviewed study has measured the exact impact, but platform surveys and coaching experience consistently confirm it.

### Photo mix

The ideal 6-photo mix (opener, lifestyle, social proof, full body, personality, wildcard) comes from **conventional wisdom** — it's widely taught in dating coaching and makes intuitive sense, but isn't from a specific study. The underlying principle — that variety builds a complete picture — is supported by self-disclosure research (see below).

## Profile Text Actually Matters (More Than People Think)

While photos dominate the initial swipe, text independently predicts attractiveness and significantly affects outcomes — especially on prompt-based apps like Hinge.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Profile text independently predicted attractiveness ratings beyond photos. Creative, original profiles rated as more intelligent, funnier, and more attractive | Fiore et al. (2008), *CHI 2008* (DOI: 10.1145/1357054.1357181) | Research |
| Users with distinctive, creative self-presentation reported higher contact rates. Unique details serve as credibility signals because they're harder to fabricate | Ellison, Heino & Gibbs (2006), *JCMC* (DOI: 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00020.x) | Research |
| Users seeking serious relationships (Hinge's core audience) valued profile completeness and text quality more than users seeking casual encounters | Sumter et al. (2017), *Telematics and Informatics* (DOI: 10.1016/j.tele.2016.04.009) | Research |
| Profiles with all prompts filled get significantly more engagement than those with empty or single-word answers | Hinge blog/press data | Platform data |

**What this means:** On Hinge specifically, text matters more than on purely swipe-based apps. The prompt architecture forces structured self-presentation, and the research says creative, specific text measurably improves outcomes.

---

## Specificity Beats Generic (Strong Evidence)

This is one of the best-supported findings in the research. Specific, concrete language consistently outperforms vague, abstract language in dating profiles.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Truthful profiles use more specific, concrete, sensory language. Deceptive profiles use vague, abstract language. Specificity signals honesty | Toma & Hancock (2012), *Journal of Communication* (DOI: 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01619.x) | Research |
| Profiles with specific, verifiable lifestyle information produced significantly higher contact rates than vague descriptors | Hitsch, Hortacsu & Ariely (2010), *Quantitative Marketing and Economics* (DOI: 10.1007/s11129-010-9088-6) | Research |
| Specificity in profiles predicted stronger first-date outcomes. Specific details led to more accurate expectations and less disappointment at first meeting | Sharabi & Caughlin (2017), *Personal Relationships* (DOI: 10.1111/pere.12188) | Research |
| Concrete, specific language (low-level construals) creates psychological closeness. Abstract language creates distance | Trope & Liberman (2010), *Psychological Review* — Construal Level Theory | Research |
| Messages referencing specific shared interests had reply rates 30-40% higher than generic openers | OkCupid/OkTrends data (also in Rudder, *Dataclysm*, 2014) | Platform data |

**What this means:** "Jazz Cafe on a weeknight" genuinely works better than "live music" — and we can explain *why*. Specificity signals authenticity (Toma & Hancock), creates psychological closeness (Construal Level Theory), and produces better real-world outcomes when people actually meet (Sharabi & Caughlin).

## Show, Don't Tell (Strong Theoretical Basis)

Demonstrating a quality works better than claiming it. This maps onto signaling theory — one of the strongest theoretical frameworks in the skill.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| In text-only environments, demonstrated qualities are processed as more credible than claimed qualities | Walther (1996), *Communication Research* — Hyperpersonal Model | Research |
| Profiles demonstrating personality through examples beat trait-adjective lists ("I am funny" vs actually being funny). More honest, more appealing, higher contact rates | Gibbs, Ellison & Heino (2006), *Communication Research* (DOI: 10.1177/0093650205285368) | Research |
| "Showing" functions as a costly signal — it requires actually having the quality. "Telling" is a cheap signal anyone can make. Costly signals are more credible and persuasive | Donath (2007), *JCMC* — Signaling in Social Supernets | Research |

**Costly vs cheap signals — the framework:**

| Signal type | Example | Why it works (or doesn't) |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------|
| **Costly** (hard to fake) | "Being nice about Timothée Chalamet" | Demonstrates actual humor — you have to be witty to write this |
| **Costly** | Specific venue/cultural references | Requires actual participation in that scene |
| **Costly** | Professional-quality photos | Investment of time and effort |
| **Cheap** (easy to fake) | "I have a great sense of humor" | Anyone can say this; tells you nothing |
| **Cheap** | "Love to travel" | Everyone says this; zero differentiation |
| **Cheap** | Basic selfies | Minimal effort signal |

This framework comes from Donath (2007) and Zahavi's handicap principle in evolutionary biology. It's the theoretical engine behind most of the copy advice in this skill.

## Humor Works (Strong Evidence)

Humor in profiles significantly increases perceived attractiveness, and there's a nuance: *producing* humor matters more than *appreciating* humor.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Humor in self-presentation significantly increased perceived attractiveness. Interpreted as signal of intelligence, creativity, and social competence | McGee & Shevlin (2009), *Journal of Psychology* (DOI: 10.3200/JRLP.143.1.67-77) | Research |
| Women preferred men who *produced* humor over men who *appreciated* humor. For men's profiles, generating humor is more effective than signaling you enjoy humor | Bressler & Balshine (2006), *Evolution and Human Behavior* (DOI: 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.04.005) | Research |
| Humor production ability correlated with measured intelligence (r = .40) and mating success. Demonstrated humor functions as an honest signal of cognitive ability | Greengross & Miller (2011), *Intelligence* (DOI: 10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006) | Research |
| Humor serves dual functions: signaling genetic fitness and indicating romantic interest | Li et al. (2009), *Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin* | Research |
| Messages containing humor had 15-20% higher reply rates than earnest messages | OkCupid/OkTrends data | Platform data |

**Important caveat:** Failed humor is worse than no humor. Excessive self-deprecation reduces perceived confidence (Lundy, Tan & Cunningham, 1998, *PSPB*). The advice is to use humor that demonstrates wit, not to force jokes that don't land.

**What this means for the skill:** "Balance edge with warmth" isn't just a style preference — it's grounded in research. Dark humor or strong opinions (edge) signal intelligence and personality. Family warmth, genuine enthusiasm (warmth) signal relationship potential. Pure edge reads as bitter; pure warmth reads as bland. The balance is the strategy.

## Self-Disclosure: How Much to Reveal

How much to share in a profile is a research question with a clear answer: moderate depth, high specificity, breadth across topics.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Breadth of disclosure (covering multiple topics) predicted higher attractiveness. Depth had a curvilinear effect — moderate depth optimal. Too shallow = boring; too deep = uncomfortable | Gibbs, Ellison & Heino (2006), *Communication Research* | Research |
| Self-disclosure increased liking, but strongest when it felt natural and appropriate to the relationship stage | Sprecher, Treger & Wondra (2013), *Journal of Relationships Research* | Research |
| Disclosure perceived as intentional and personal creates more intimacy than disclosure that feels mass-broadcast | Jiang, Bazarova & Hancock (2011), *Human Communication Research* | Research |

**The practical framework:**

| Disclosure level | Example | Effect |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Moderate depth, high specificity | "I hate-watch Saturday Kitchen every week" | Creates connection without oversharing |
| Breadth across topics | Humor + values + lifestyle across 3 prompts | Shows you're a whole person |
| Controlled vulnerability | Admitting a guilty pleasure | Builds perceived authenticity |
| Too shallow | "I like music and food" | Boring, no connection |
| Too deep | "Still recovering from my parents' divorce" | Violates norms for this stage |

**What this means for the skill:** The discovery interview is designed to surface moderate-depth, high-specificity material. That's not an accident — it maps to what self-disclosure research says works. The 150-character Hinge limit actually helps by forcing concision.

---

## Competition Dynamics (Sobering Data)

The dating app market is extremely unequal. Understanding this grounds the "reality check" phase.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Most users pursue partners ~25% more desirable than themselves. Desirability follows a power-law distribution — top profiles receive 10-100x the messages of median profiles | Bruch & Newman (2018), *Science Advances* (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aap9815) | Research |
| Top 10% of male profiles received ~58% of all female likes. Women were 7x more selective than men | Tyson et al. (2016), IEEE/ACM ASONAM | Research |
| Strong homophily effects — people preferentially contact those similar on education, cultural tastes, lifestyle markers. Specific cultural references function as sorting mechanisms | Fiore & Donath (2005), *CHI Extended Abstracts* | Research |
| Users with more "desirable" profiles were significantly more selective and more sensitive to profile quality indicators | Hitsch, Hortacsu & Ariely (2010) | Research |

**What this means:** The strategy isn't volume — it's being memorable to the right people. In competitive markets, attractive profiles receive 50-100+ likes per week (platform data, conventional wisdom). Most profiles receive far fewer. Profile quality determines which algorithmic tier you occupy, which determines who sees you.

This is why the skill focuses on differentiation and filtering rather than broad appeal. You're not trying to be liked by everyone — you're trying to be unforgettable to the 30-50 right people.

---

## Algorithm & Engagement

What's known about how Hinge's algorithm works, and what's speculation.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Likes with comments are significantly more likely to lead to conversations than bare likes | Hinge press/blog data (circa 2018-2019) | Platform data |
| "Most Compatible" matches are significantly more likely to result in dates (Hinge claims 8x) | Hinge press release, 2018, announcing Most Compatible feature. Uses Gale-Shapley algorithm | Platform data |
| Hinge's algorithm rewards: profile completeness, engagement quality, response rate, activity consistency | Hinge blog/press, various | Platform data |

**What we can infer but can't prove:**
- Incomplete profiles likely get deprioritized (Hinge nudges completion; all recommendation systems reward complete data)
- Response rate likely affects visibility (standard in recommendation systems, but Hinge hasn't confirmed specifics)
- Daily activity likely keeps profiles visible (common across dating apps, but specifics are proprietary)

**The "10-20% like rate sweet spot"** — this is **conventional wisdom** from dating coaches. No published data confirms this specific number. The principle (being somewhat selective signals quality) is plausible but unverified.

## Authenticity and Self-Presentation

The research on deception in dating profiles has a useful implication: authentic profiles work better, not just morally but strategically.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| 81% of online daters lied about at least one attribute, but deceptions were small — people stretch truth rather than fabricate. The "foggy mirror" principle: slightly idealized but recognizable | Toma, Hancock & Ellison (2008), *PSPB* (DOI: 10.1177/0146167208318067) | Research |
| Profile text was more accurate than photos; text was a better predictor of the actual person | Hancock & Toma (2009), *Journal of Communication* (DOI: 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01420.x) | Research |
| Creating an online dating profile affected how people saw themselves — profiles become self-fulfilling identity claims | Toma (2015), *Communication Research* | Research |
| Generic profiles produced less accurate impressions and lower follow-through when people met. Originality bridges the gap between text and reality | Frost, Chance, Norton & Ariely (2008), *Journal of Interactive Marketing* | Research |

**What this means for the skill:** The "status affirming" philosophy — showing who someone actually is rather than inventing a persona — isn't just kind, it's strategically optimal. Authentic profiles create accurate expectations, which leads to better first dates, which leads to actual relationships. The Toma (2015) finding is particularly interesting: helping someone write a genuine, compelling profile can actually increase their confidence, not just their match rate.

---

## Profile Text Length

How much to write — the research says moderate length with high information density.

| Finding | Source | Evidence tier |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Curvilinear relationship: very short profiles rated poorly, moderate length performed best, very long showed diminishing returns | Fiore et al. (2008), *CHI 2008* | Research |
| Longer profiles (up to a point) correlated with more contacts, but extremely long profiles saw decline | Hitsch et al. (2010) | Research |
| Profiles between 100-200 words performed best for women; 100-300 for men. Under 50 and over 500 both underperformed | OkCupid/OkTrends data; Rudder, *Dataclysm* (2014) | Platform data |

On Hinge, the architecture handles this: 3 prompts x 150 characters = 450 characters max. The constraint enforces concision. The research says: use all the space, but make every word count.

## A Note on Evidence

Earlier versions of this document cited specific statistics ("10x impact," "178% more matches," "78% turn-off") attributed to sources that either don't exist as published research or are commercial blogs presenting marketing data as studies. We've replaced those with honestly sourced findings.

The advice in this skill is directionally consistent with what the research shows. Where we cite specific numbers, we name the actual source. Where the evidence is conventional wisdom rather than formal research, we say so. The goal is to be useful and honest, not to inflate credibility with fake precision.
