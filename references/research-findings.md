## Photo Strategy

### First Photo Requirements
- Clear face, genuine smile
- Well-lit, professional quality
- Eye contact with camera
- Solo, uncluttered background
- NOT: selfie, lying down, orange lighting, sunglasses

### Ideal Photo Mix (6 photos)
1. **Strong opener** - Clear face, warmth, genuine expression
2. **Lifestyle/context** - Shows their world
3. **Social proof** - With friends (face still clear)
4. **Full body** - Outdoor, natural setting
5. **Personality/interest** - Activity, venue, passion
6. **Wildcard** - Humor, conversation starter

### Photo Red Flags
- Mirror selfies (78% turn-off)
- Bathroom pics
- Group photos where subject unclear
- Sunglasses hiding face
- Heavy filters
- All selfies (signals no friends)

## Signaling Theory

### Costly Signals (Hard to Fake = Credible)
- Professional photos (investment of time/money)
- Specific cultural references (requires actual participation)
- Evidence of professional achievement
- Insider knowledge of scenes/venues

### Cheap Signals (Easy to Fake = Less Credible)
- Generic statements ("love to laugh")
- Basic selfies
- Vague interests
- Empty superlatives

### Why Comments Beat Likes
Research shows "likes with comments" function as costly signals - they require time and effort, indicating genuine interest. This is why they're 2x more effective.

## Algorithm Mechanics

### Hard Filters (Hide You Completely)
- Location radius
- Age range
- Dealbreakers (height, children, religion, etc.)

### Soft Signals (Move You Up/Down)
- Profile completeness
- First photo quality
- Comment rate on likes
- Reply speed
- Chat engagement
- Activity level

### Visibility Tiers
- **Top tier (Standouts):** Complete, engaging, high-quality photos, good engagement
- **Middle tier:** Decent profiles, moderate engagement
- **Low tier:** Incomplete, poor photos, low engagement

Incomplete profiles get algorithmically deprioritized before humans even see them.

## What Quality Matches Are Looking For

### Attracts Quality
- Specificity over generality
- Conversation hooks (easy to respond to)
- Cultural engagement evidence
- Authentic personality markers
- Confidence without arrogance
- Clear relationship intent

### Repels Quality
- Low effort profiles (signals low interest)
- Generic statements ("partner in crime")
- Negativity or defensiveness
- Excessive requirements lists
- Heavy filtering/only angles
- All group photos

---

## Profile Text Research

### What Works
- **Originality:** Creative profiles rated as more intelligent, funnier, more attractive
- **Specificity:** "Jazz Cafe on a weeknight" beats "live music"
- **Purpose:** Profiles with sense of direction rated higher
- **Hooks:** Elements that invite questions or comments
- **Show don't tell:** Demonstrate personality rather than stating it

### What Doesn't Work
- Generic statements everyone uses
- Long lists of requirements
- Negativity about past experiences
- Excessive self-deprecation
- Vague descriptors ("fun-loving", "easygoing")

---

## The Competition Reality

For someone targeting quality matches in a competitive market:

- They're competing against optimized profiles
- High-value targets get 100+ likes/week
- First photo is the primary filter point
- Incomplete profiles get filtered before content is read
- Quality over quantity is the only viable strategy
