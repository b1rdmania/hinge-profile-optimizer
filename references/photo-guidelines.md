## First Photo (Most Critical)

First photo has **10x the impact** of bio text. This is where most people decide to keep looking or move on.

### Requirements
- ☐ Face clearly visible (no sunglasses, not too distant)
- ☐ Good lighting (natural light best)
- ☐ Genuine expression (real smile, not forced)
- ☐ Solo (not cropped from group)
- ☐ Not a selfie
- ☐ Clean background (not cluttered)
- ☐ Eye contact with camera
- ☐ Recent (within last year)

### First Photo Red Flags
- Selfie (especially mirror selfie)
- Lying down
- Sunglasses
- Group photo
- Too distant (can't see face)
- Heavy filters
- Bathroom
- Orange/bad lighting

### Position 1: The Opener
**Purpose:** Make them want to see more
- Best face photo
- Genuine warmth
- Clear, well-lit
- Makes a good first impression

### Position 2: Context/Lifestyle
**Purpose:** Show their world

### Position 3: Social Proof
**Purpose:** Show they have people in their life

- Shows they're not a loner

### Position 4: Full Body
**Purpose:** Build trust, show they're not hiding
- Outdoor, natural setting

## Photo Evaluation Checklist

For each photo, assess:

| Criteria | Score 1-5 |
|----------|-----------|
| Face visibility | |
| Lighting quality | |
| Expression/energy | |
| Story/context | |
| Technical quality | |
| Conversation potential | |

### What Story Does This Photo Tell?

For each photo, articulate:
- What does this show about them?
- What kind of person would be attracted to this?
- Does it add something the other photos don't?
- Could someone easily comment on it?

## Red Flags to Eliminate

### Immediate Deletes
- **Mirror selfies** (78% turn-off, signals low effort)
- **Bathroom photos** (weird, low effort)
- **Shirtless gym pics** (unless that's explicitly their target)
- **Fish photos** (cliché, polarizing)
- **Heavily filtered** (signals hiding something)

### Probably Delete
- All selfies (suggests no friends to take photos)
- Group photos where subject unclear
- Sunglasses in multiple photos (hiding)
- Same angle/pose repeated
- Very old photos (misleading)
- Photos with exes cropped out (obvious)

### Context-Dependent
- Photos with kids (depends on their situation/target)
- Photos with alcohol (depends on vibe)
- Travel photos (fine, but not all travel)

## Common Gaps

### What's Usually Missing

**Workspace/Professional Context**
- Creative work environment
- Evidence of what they do
- Not corporate headshot, but authentic work setting

**Cultural Engagement**
- At gallery, venue, event
- Shows they actually do things
- Insider signal for similar people

**Full Body Outdoors**
- Not cropped, natural setting
- Builds trust
- Shows active lifestyle

**Social Photos Where Face is Clear**
- With friends but identifiable
- Not just group shots
- Warm, having fun

## Photo Shoot Guidance

If they need new photos, suggest:

**Framing:**
- "Let's get some photos that show your life"
- NOT "dating profile photoshoot" (too performative)

**What to Capture:**
1. Portrait in good natural light (near window, golden hour)
2. At a venue/place they actually go
3. Doing an activity they enjoy
4. With friends who can take candids
5. In their workspace (if interesting)

**Tips:**
- Natural light (near windows, outside)
- Take many, select few
- Candid often beats posed
- Ask a friend to take, not tripod/self-timer
- Capture real moments, not staged

---

## Ordering Logic

**Front-load strength:** Best photos first, algorithm and humans both prioritize early photos.

**Variety:** Each photo should add something different.

**Story arc:** Photos together should give sense of who this person is and what their life is like.

**End strong:** Last photo should be memorable - humor, personality, conversation starter.

---

## Caption Strategy

Every photo with a prompt should have actual text.

**Photo captions should:**
- Add context the photo doesn't show
- Create conversation hooks
- Show personality
- Be concise (photo is doing most of the work)

**Don't:**
- Leave prompts empty (defeats the purpose)
- Just describe what's in the photo
- Be generic ("Good times!")
