# Copy Principles

What makes profile copy work, with annotated examples.

---

## The Core Idea

Profile copy should:
1. Show who they actually are (not who they think they should be)
2. Give people something to respond to (conversation hooks)
3. Attract the right people AND repel the wrong ones (filtering)
4. Be memorable (stand out from thousands of generic profiles)

## Principles

### 1. Specificity > Generic

Generic statements are forgettable and say nothing. Specific details show personality and create hooks.

| Generic (Bad) | Specific (Good) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "I love live music" | "Jazz Cafe on a weeknight" |
| "I like exploring the city" | "Walking everywhere with nowhere to be" |
| "I appreciate good food" | "Strong opinions about where to find the best ramen" |
| "I have a good sense of humor" | "I hate-watch Saturday Kitchen. Every week." |
| "Family is important to me" | "My 92-year-old great uncle could beat you at pub quiz" |

**The test:** Could 10,000 other people say the exact same thing? Then it's too generic.

### 2. Every Element = Conversation Hook

Every prompt answer should make it easy for someone to start a conversation.

**Good hooks invite:**
- Questions ("Wait, why do you hate him?")
- Shared opinions ("Oh my god I also hate that")
- Playful challenges ("I bet I could beat your uncle")
- Stories ("Tell me about that")

**Bad hooks are closed:**
- "I love my friends and family" (what do you say to this?)
- "Looking for someone genuine" (okay... and?)
- "Work hard play hard" (meaningless)

### 3. Filter In AND Filter Out

The goal isn't maximum likes - it's the right likes.

Good copy should:
- Make ideal matches think "yes, this person gets it"
- Make wrong matches think "not for me" (and that's good)

**Filtering mechanisms:**
- Niche references (insiders recognize, others don't)
- Strong opinions (compatible people agree, others bounce)
- Specific humor (right people laugh, wrong people confused)
- Cultural markers (signals belonging to particular worlds)

### 4. Balance Edge with Warmth

All edge = reads as bitter, negative, hard to be around
All warmth = reads as bland, generic, forgettable

**The formula:** Dark humor or strong opinions PLUS genuine warmth markers

**Warmth markers:**
- Family connections (especially specific/unusual ones)
- Care for friends
- Genuine enthusiasm for things
- Vulnerability (appropriate level)
- Pets

### 5. Show, Don't Tell

Stating a quality is weak. Demonstrating it is strong.

| Telling (Weak) | Showing (Strong) |
|----------------|------------------|
| "I have dark humor" | "Being nice about Timothée Chalamet." |
| "I'm adventurous" | "Last month I took a train with no destination" |
| "I'm creative" | "I make exhibition catalogues for galleries" |
| "I value depth" | Reference to specific artists/thinkers/works |
| "I'm fun" | Specific story that demonstrates fun |

## Annotated Examples

### Example 1: The Opinion Hook

**Prompt:** "Together we can be terrible at"
**Answer:** "Being nice about Timothée Chalamet."

**Why it works:**
- Specific opinion (not generic)
- Polarizing = filters (fans swipe left, haters engage)
- Implies dark humor without stating it
- Instant conversation hook (everyone has a take)
- "Together" = collaborative framing, not solo bitterness
- Memorable (no one else has this exact take)

---

### Example 2: The Warmth + Uniqueness Combo

**Prompt:** "I'm convinced that"
**Answer:** "My 92-year-old great uncle could beat you at pub quiz. No offense."

**Why it works:**
- Completely unique (nobody else has this)
- Shows family warmth without being generic
- Playful challenge invites response
- "No offense" = dry wit
- Specific enough to be memorable
- Creates easy conversation starter

---

### Example 3: The Cultural Dog Whistle

**Prompt:** "My simple pleasures"
**Answer:** "Brutalist architecture and a good wander with nowhere to be."

**Why it works:**
- "Brutalist architecture" = design/architecture nerd filter
- Specific taste signals cultural engagement
- "Nowhere to be" = relaxed, not performatively busy
- Attracts: people who know what brutalism is
- Repels: people who need activities planned

---

### Example 4: The Guilty Pleasure Reveal

**Prompt:** "Don't judge me"
**Answer:** "I hate-watch Saturday Kitchen. Every week."

**Why it works:**
- Unexpected (not the usual guilty pleasures)
- Self-aware (knows it's ridiculous)
- Specific (not "cooking shows" but THIS one)
- British humor that resonates with right audience
- Easy conversation hook ("Who's your least favorite chef?")

---

### Example 5: The Cultural Insider

**Prompt:** "I go crazy for"
**Answer:** "Exhibition catalogues, Jazz Cafe on a weeknight, and people who walk everywhere."

**Why it works:**
- Three specific things (not generic categories)
- "Exhibition catalogues" = art world insider signal
- "Jazz Cafe" = specific venue, London cultural marker
- "People who walk everywhere" = lifestyle marker
- Each element filters for similar people

---

### Example 6: The Self-Deprecating Flex

**Prompt:** "Believe it or not"
**Answer:** "Literally my life. [Meme about career]. [Business name]: where corporate logos go to get slightly better."

**Why it works:**
- Uses humor to mention work without bragging
- Self-deprecating but confident
- Shows they don't take themselves too seriously
- Industry insider joke lands with right people
- Meme format = personality

## What to Avoid

### Generic Phrases (Everyone Says These)
- "Love to laugh"
- "Partner in crime"
- "Looking for my person"
- "Work hard play hard"
- "Living my best life"
- "Not here for hookups"
- "Love adventures"
- "Good vibes only"

### Closed Statements (No Hook)
- "Family and friends are important to me"
- "I value honesty"
- "Looking for something real"

### Negativity Without Balance
- "No time wasters"
- "If you can't handle me at my worst..."
- "Tired of games"
- Long lists of dealbreakers

### Vague Descriptors
- "Fun-loving"
- "Easygoing"
- "Down to earth"
- "Old soul"

## The Process

1. **Pull from discovery:** What specific details emerged?
2. **Find the unique:** What does no one else have?
3. **Create hooks:** How can each element start a conversation?
4. **Check filtering:** Who does this attract/repel?
5. **Balance tone:** Edge + warmth in right proportion
6. **Test specificity:** Could 10,000 people say this?
7. **Read aloud:** Does it sound like them?
