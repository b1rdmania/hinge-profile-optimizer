# Hinge Profile Optimizer

Everyone has something. The way they think, what they care about, their weird specific interests, how they show up for people, what makes them laugh.

Most dating profiles bury this under generic prompts and bad photo choices.

This skill finds it and puts it where people can see it.

## ⏱️ Time Investment

**This takes 60-90 minutes.**

Not a quick fix. Not "5 tips for better prompts."

This is the full process: research-backed audit, proper discovery interview, strategic photo selection, copy that sounds like you, settings optimization, and implementation support.

Strap in. It's a small investment to meet your life partner. Or your weekend 9/10 hookup. We don't judge.

## Philosophy

**You're not making someone more appealing. You're making them visible.**

The interesting stuff is already there. A 92-year-old great uncle who's a pub quiz champion. An irrational hatred of a specific celebrity. A hate-watch ritual every Saturday morning. The exhibition catalogue they're prouder of than anything else they've made.

These details get lost in "love to laugh" and "partner in crime."

This process pulls them out.

## What We Actually Do

### Phase 0: Setup
Set expectations. Frame the process. Make it clear this isn't an interrogation — we're gathering ingredients to cook with. Nothing is mandatory, dictate answers if typing's a chore, skip anything you want.

### Phase 1: Audit
If you have a current profile, we score it. Photos, prompts, completeness, what it's actually signaling vs what you think it's signaling. Honest but kind. "Here's what's working, here's the opportunities."

### Phase 2: Discovery
The heart of it. We ask a lot of questions — work, interests, opinions, relationships, lifestyle, guilty pleasures, pet peeves, weird rituals. Looking for the specific stuff. The things that make you *you*. We won't use everything. We're finding where to lean in.

### Phase 3: Reality Check
Gentle market math. Who are you trying to attract? Is your age range realistic? Is your distance too narrow? Are your dealbreakers filtering out people you'd actually like? Honest conversation about strategy — quality over quantity, memorable to the right people.

### Phase 4: Photos
Evaluate what you have. Score each one. Identify gaps (workspace shot? full body? social proof?). Set the order — first photo has 10x the impact of everything else. If you need new photos, we'll tell you exactly what to shoot.

### Phase 5: Copy
Write the actual prompts and captions. Using your discovery material, not generic templates. Specific, hookable, filtered for the right people. Every element should start a conversation. 150 characters, every word earns its place.

### Phase 6: Settings
The stuff people forget. Distance, age range, dealbreakers, what's visible at the top of your profile. Hide the clutter (star signs, probably). Optimize for visibility.

### Phase 7: Implementation
We don't just hand you a document. We help you put it live. Photo order, copy-paste each prompt, settings adjustments, preview check, go live. Done together.

### Phase 8: Algorithm Strategy
Post-launch guidance. Daily activity, always comment (never empty likes), response timing, selectivity, what to expect in weeks 1-4.

## The Point

There's someone for everyone. They just can't find each other when every profile says the same thing.

This skill helps people show who they actually are to the people who'd appreciate that person.
