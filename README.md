# Hinge Profile Optimizer

Everyone has something. The way they think, what they care about, their weird specific interests, how they show up for people, what makes them laugh.

Most dating profiles bury this under generic prompts and bad photo choices.

This skill finds it and puts it where people can see it.

## Philosophy

**You're not making someone more appealing. You're making them visible.**

The interesting stuff is already there. A 92-year-old great uncle who's a pub quiz champion. An irrational hatred of a specific celebrity. A hate-watch ritual every Saturday morning. The exhibition catalogue they're prouder of than anything else they've made.

These details get lost in "love to laugh" and "partner in crime."

This process pulls them out.

## What This Is

A comprehensive, research-backed approach to Hinge profile optimization.

- **45+ peer-reviewed sources** on dating app behavior, signaling theory, and algorithm mechanics
- **8-phase process** from discovery to implementation
- **~60-90 minutes** for the full process
- **Principles over templates** — find *their* version, not a copy of someone else's

## The Process

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **0. Setup** | Frame the process, reduce defensiveness |
| **1. Audit** | Score current profile against research |
| **2. Discovery** | The big interview — find the real person |
| **3. Reality Check** | Market math, settings alignment |
| **4. Photos** | Evaluate, order, identify gaps |
| **5. Copy** | Write prompts and captions |
| **6. Settings** | Optimize visibility, reduce clutter |
| **7. Implementation** | Put it live together |

Not everyone needs every phase. The skill adapts.

## The Point

There's someone for everyone. They just can't find each other when every profile says the same thing.

This skill helps people show who they actually are to the people who'd appreciate that person.
